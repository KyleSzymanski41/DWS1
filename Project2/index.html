		<h2 id="what">What is Lamborghini?</h2>
		
		<p><strong>Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A.</strong> is an <strong>Italian</strong> brand and manufacturer of <u>luxury sports cars</u> and, <u>formerly, SUVs</u>, which is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary brand division <em>Audi</em>. Lamborghini's production facility and headquarters are located in Sant'Agata Bolognese Italy. In 2011, Lamborghini's 831 employees produced 1,711 vehicles.</p>

		<p><strong>Ferruccio Lamborghini</strong>, an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with established marques, including <strong>Ferrari</strong>. The company gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports coupé, which established rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance cars of the era. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's <em>Audi division</em>.</p>

		<p>New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand Lamborghini. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 percent.</p>

		<p>Lamborghini produces sports cars and <abbr title="12 cylinder engine">"V12" </abbr> engines for offshore powerboat racing. Lamborghini currently produces the V12-powered Aventador and the <abbr title="10 cylinder engine">"V10-powered"</abbr> Huracán.</p>
		
		<h2 id="history">The History of Lamborghini.</h2>
		
		<p>Manufacturing magnate <strong>Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini</strong> founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models were released in the mid-1960s and were noted for their refinement, power and comfort. Lamborghini gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports coupé, which established <abbr title=" located in the rear of the vehicle">"rear mid-engine"</abbr>, rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance cars of the era.</p>

		<p>Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold ownership of the company to <strong>Georges-Henri Rossetti</strong> and <strong>René Leimer</strong> and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers <strong>Jean-Claude</strong> and <strong>Patrick Mimran</strong> in 1980. The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and invested heavily in the company's expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high performance off-road vehicle.</p>

		<p>The Mimrans sold Lamborghini to the <strong>Chrysler Corporation</strong> in 1987. After replacing the Countach with the Diablo and discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to Malaysian investment group <strong>Mycom Setdco</strong> and Indonesian group <strong>V'Power Corporation</strong> in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the <strong>Volkswagen Group</strong> where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division. New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand Lamborghini. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 percent.</p>
